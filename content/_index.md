WorldWide Telescope is a software environment that enables your
computer to function as a virtual telescope, combining terabytes of imagery
from such famous telescopes as Hubble, Chandra and Spitzer into one vast
panorama of the universe.

{% note(html=1) %}
While this guide was written for the Windows version of WWT, it should also be
helpful for understanding the WWT <a
href="//worldwidetelescope.org/webclient/">web client</a> since its user
interface mirrors that of the Windows program. However, some specialized
features are unavailable in the web client. Weâ€™re working to annotate this
guide to show which parts are Windows-specific. Your contributions to that
effort would be much appreciated!

WorldWide Telescope allows seamless panning and zooming around the night sky,
our Solar System, and other space-orientated panoramas, such as the pictures
taken of the surfaces of the Moon and Mars. [Explore](@/explore/index.md) the
sky at multiple wavelengths: see the x-ray view of the sky and zoom into
bright radiation clouds, and then cross-fade into the visible light view and
discover the cloud remnants of a supernova explosion from a thousand years
ago. Switch to the Hydrogen Alpha view to see the distribution and
illumination of massive primordial hydrogen cloud structures lit up by the
high energy radiation coming from nearby stars in the Milky Way.

For a dazzling educational experience, our Solar System is modeled in three
dimensions, with the planets rotating and orbiting the Sun. Watch the majestic
beauty of Saturn's rings or the distant orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto as
they track across the sky in their accurately modeled days and years.
Accelerate the simulated time to plan a visit to the best spot for the next
solar or lunar eclipse.

Newcomers to WorldWide Telescope are recommended to browse the growing number
of [Guided Tours](@/guidedtours/index.md) of the sky by astronomers and
educators from some of the most respected observatories and planetariums. Most
of the features can be discovered simply by using the program. This
documentation is provided as a resource to help describe what is going on, and
to help locate the features that this project has to offer. There are two
versions of WorldWide Telescope, a Windows application and a web client. This
documentation set describes both, where necessary indicating where a feature
only applies to one. The essential differences between the two are that the
Windows version is downloaded and installed first, then run, and has a few
more features. The web client is not downloaded and installed, is based on
HTML5, and has fewer features but can be customized.
