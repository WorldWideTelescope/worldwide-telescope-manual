The best place to get help and support for WWT is the
[WWT user forum][forum]. We aspire for the WWT community to
be a friendly and supportive place, so please don’t hesitate to reach out!

[forum]: https://wwt-forum.org/

Bugs in the system can be filed as issues in
[the WWT organization on GitHub](https://github.com/WorldWideTelescope/). If
you’re unfamiliar with the WWT technical infrastructure, however, it can be
hard to know where exactly to file your issue. If in doubt, ask on
[the forum][forum] first.

Finally, if these public options don’t meet your needs, you can also email
<wwt@aas.org>.
