WorldWide Telescope can be used by Earth scientists to study events on our own planet in some detail. The main feature for this purpose is the **Layer Manager**, which enables layers of data to be rendered on the 3D model of the Earth, where those layers are either static data such as boundaries (political boundaries, watersheds, tectonic plate boundaries, to name a few examples), or dynamic data reporting events on a time line (earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanoes and similar natural events perhaps being the most dramatic, but simple changes in vegetation, sea level, water flow, and so on can also be represented). Static data is usually represented by shape files (lists of vectors defining regions, large and small), and dynamic data is usually represented by spreadsheet data (columns of events, latitude and longitude, times and the magnitude and persistence of the event).

Layers can also be applied to the Sun, the other planets, and some of the moons, in our solar system.

Layers can be added and used as part of [Guided Tours](#GuidedTours).
