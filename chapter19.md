### <a name="TimeSeriesData">Time Series Data</a>

Time series data is typically a list of events that occurred at a very specific time (such as earthquakes), or were initiated at a certain time and persist.

To add a layer of time series data, click the **Add** button on the Layer Manager, or right-click on the node where the data should be added, and select **Add** from the menu; select the file of data to be added from the Open File dialog. The import of data from an Excel spreadsheet will be made easier if there are column headings in the spreadsheet that are helpful, as WorldWide Telescope uses these to make a best guess as to their purpose. It does not matter if there are more columns in the spreadsheet than are needed - the extraneous columns will be ignored. The spreadsheet should be in .csv or .txt format.

Following the selection of the appropriate file, a series of Data Visualization dialogs will appear that are used to configure the data for WorldWide Telescope:

When this dialog appears, first give the data layer a friendly name, and select from the drop down list of coordinate types (often the default of spherical will apply).

Follow the instructions in the dialogs, carefully matching the column headings in the spreadsheet to those requested by the Data Visualization tool.

#### Setting Time Series Data Running

To set the time series data running, select and highlight the layer in the **Layer Manager.** Then ensure the **Time Series** and (optionally) the **Auto Loop** checkboxes are selected. Then go to the [View Menu](#TheViewMenu) and accelerate time to see the visualization of the events.
