### <a name="ContextSearch">Context Search</a>

The _Context Search_ automatically searches the constellation that the reticle is currently on for deep sky objects that are listed in a catalog, such as the Messier or New General catalogs. If it finds any objects, its thumbnail image is added to the list in the lower panel. As you move the Field of View (FOV) to a new constellation, the thumbnails for the deep sky objects change automatically to reflect all the deep sky objects in the new constellation.

To obtain some information on the items in the Context Search, right-click on the thumbnails in the lower panel and select **Properties** from the menu. This will display the same information that appears in the [The Finder Scope](#TheFinderScope), for example:

| ![](uiimages/ContextProperties.jpg) | In this example M86 has appeared in the lower panel as a result of the context search. Selecting **Properties** from the right-click menu displays the property data without changing the view. |

#### Context Search Filter

You can restrict the list of deep sky objects displayed by the Context Search to only those objects identified in the following table, by selecting items in the **Context Search Filter**.

Click on the thumbnail images below to link to the example. And then click on the thumbnails as they appear in the top panel to bring the objects into view.
