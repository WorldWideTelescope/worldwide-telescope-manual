#### <a name="FITSImages">FITS Images</a>

The FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) was developed particularly to hold the one, two and three dimensional data that is particular to astronomy, with the requirement for a large amount of metadata to be stored along with an image or table of data. For specific details refer to [FITS Data Format](http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits.html).

If a FITS image is loaded into WorldWide Telescope some additional analysis options become available. To load a FITS image simply use the **Explore > Open > Image...** option, and note that the **Scale** icon appears in the lower panel alongside the **Image Crossfade** slider:

| ![](uiimages/FITSScale.jpg) | Click on the **Scale** icon to display a light intensity histogram. |
| ![](uiimages/FitsHistogram.jpg) | Slide the green and red bars to select the starting and ending points for the display, then select from **Linear**, **Log**, **Power**, **Square Root** to determine how the data is to be displayed in the main view. Note that the red bar can precede the green bar to invert the slope. The bars limit the range of data that is to be displayed, and the slope determines the emphasis given to the data.
The final option, **Histogram Equalization**, does not use the bars, but instead gives equal emphasis to each intensity level of the data.

Note that there are 256 intensity levels, from pure black on the left margin of the histogram, to pure white on the right. The height of any bar in the histogram indicates the number of pixels in the image at that particular intensity level.

The zoom in and zoom out options enable greater focus on a particular band of data.

Using this tool particular light sources can be examined in isolation. |
